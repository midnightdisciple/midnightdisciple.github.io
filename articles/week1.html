<p>I find it necessary to give something like some form of context for who I am and what this is in relation to me. There is no reason for this. Nobody, likely not even me, will ever read this or any of the other articles on this website. Nevertheless, I will attempt to give some context.</p>
<h2 id="why-this">Why This?</h2>
<p>My life can be accurately summed up as a series of attempts to overcome or escape reality, or perhaps more accurately, escape myself. The most recent of which primarily involved me ingesting large quantities of psychedelic drugs as often as I found reasonable for something like 5 months.</p>
<p>This unfortunately <em>did not</em> grant me the ability to auto-win life as I had been seeking. Instead, it revealed to me that any such attempt had always been foolish. My primary mechanism of engaging with reality, that is, to ‘win’ or ‘get one over’ is a fundamentally flawed approach as there is no prize to attain and nothing to get except more life.</p>
<p>This has consequently opened a black hole in my mind. With no game to win and nothing to do except engage in the deeply repugnant business of being an ordinary and admittedly quite mediocre person for the remainder of my life. I am seeking to write every week of 2025 for two primary purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>That I may find some reprieve from the banal insanity of life by focusing my efforts on something tangible</li>
<li>That I may by chance reveal some pattern within myself that will enable me to suffer less in my continued existence</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure more information about my negative behavioral patterns and pathologies will come up throughout the many articles I intend to write, but for now, let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="synthpop-in-the-modern-matrix--god-in-the-machine">Synthpop in the Modern Matrix &amp; God in the Machine</h2>
<pre><code>Deus Ex Machina

Crosses burned away
Angles cut within
Soldered lines astray
God reborn in sin

- poem by me following the reemergence of religious belief on 220 μg of lsd
</code></pre>
<p>As either a last hurrah or a nail in the coffin to my pursuit of drug experiences over reality. I took 2 tabs of acid the day after Christmas. I had the pleasure of listening to a delightful synthpop record by the name of Imaginal Disc. Here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>For one last piece of context, while on lsd, there’s a strange and interesting experience that happens. I’m only an undergraduate level psychonaut so I don’t have precise terminology to describe it, but the term I’ve come up with is Synesthetic Mashing. The basic shape of this phenomenon is that single cognition will be threaded from multiple smaller, seemingly unrelated, experiences.</p>
<p>This means that when Magdalena Bay says ‘she looked like me!’ the words strike me across several dimensions of meaning. I am, all at once, struck with the image of the woman on the album, called to remember all of the times I have seen myself in someone else, brought to an increased awareness of my own personal character as well as my appearance and how others have impacted and been impacted by it, and granted the awareness that, deep down, I am no different than anyone else, that they all ‘look like me’.</p>
<p>Similarly, on ‘Killing Time’, Magdalena Bay sings at once to me and from within me, somehow managing to narrate my inner thoughts on my continued relationship with time, specifically in regards to technology (which the albums style and art constantly calls to mind) with sensationally horrifying lines like, ‘always killing time, never getting mine’, ‘it only takes a minute to forget a week’, and ‘if time is meant for living, whys it killing me?’. The song instantly pulls my awareness into a challenging space of reflection on my continued inability to make something meaningful out of my life while I continue to find distractions to ‘kill time’.</p>
<p>With the track titled ‘Image’, the album hits its stride and so does my brain, mashing a bizarre mix of dystopian ideas. Lines like ‘make me in your image… through a two way mirror’ become a double entendre, at once capturing the relationship between the artist and me through the art medium; Magdalena Bay writes about a fictionalized version of herself and explores her own mind through the album, while I consume the album as a transformative and introspective experience. Simultaneously, I am called to recognized the dual relationship that our society has with technology where to our uncaring algorithms, we are data to manipulate, and to us, they reflect images and memes designed to play into pathologies and ego in psychosexual roleplay. The album is then a double two way mirror while I am remade in it’s image.</p>
<p>‘Death &amp; Romance’ is perhaps the most succinct distillation of every profound spiritual and metaphysical truth I have ever learned through meditation and psychedelic drugs. The message is simple and summed up towards the end of the song with, ‘this dance wont end, it goes forever, romance and death, keep us together’. Simply put, despite all attempts of humans to understand and puzzle over their and realities natures, the simple truth is that truth doesn’t stop to wait for them. In wondering what you will do or what you are, you have done and been something in the meantime.</p>
<p>The album continues to riff on these themes. Continuing to explore the existential questions that all humans face: confronting monsters within and without, grapping with morality, self abandonment in the face of adversity, but ultimately comes to a fairly uncynical and happy ending with melodies that echo back to the beginning of the album.</p>
