<p>Trump cultists, or Maggats as I call them (as well as those sufficiently mind rotted as to essentially be complicit in his obvious and unmitigated political narcissism), seem to believe that he is a kind of Messianic figure. That is, in their eyes, he can essentially do no wrong, he is the axis upon which morality rests and revolves. Whether or not they will admit this is a matter of little importance, all that is required is that they play along with his continued delusions, and <em><strong>they are delusions</strong></em>. Not lies, not four-dimensional chess maneuvers (as the Maggats my try to convince you); no, Trump fully believes everything he says and believes <em>in</em> everything he does.</p>
<p>This is expected for a pathological narcissist. Narcissists are infamous for their ability to manipulate, deceive, and gaslight those to fulfill their emotional needs; what’s important to understand though, is that a narcissist <em><strong>never truly lies</strong></em>. A lie can be fairly defined as an assertion known reasonably to be false or misleading by whomever asserts it. This means that, if you say something, being fully convinced of its accuracy, you <em><strong>may be wrong</strong></em>, but you <em><strong>have not lied</strong></em>. As an example, a husband who tells his wife that he will be home by 5:30 from work, and then runs late due to a wreck on the highway could, in no world, be fairly called a liar. A narcissist, due to their unique undeveloped sense of self and object relations, uses language, not to <em><strong>describe reality</strong></em>, but to <em><strong>create it</strong></em>. This is ‘delusion’ as distinct from ‘deceit’.</p>
<p>This perfectly positions Trump to be understood as a messianic figure. His wealth, influence, and now his political power in conjunction with his delusional belief in himself and his actions means that all someone has to do to get a secondhand high off of the narcissist supply is delude themselves with him, board the “Trump Train” so to speak . In the horrible melding of Trump’s perfect self-belief and our current combined and influence based political-media environment, Trump’s delusions, his reality is made real before his eyes. But what of those who align against The Don?</p>
<p>Trump Derangement Syndrome (shorthanded as TDS by Maggats) is real, and also a projection. Such a shocking rejection of truth on the part of The Trumples cannot be done without some feeling of internal dissonance. In their case this dissonance is projected onto their opposition in the form of accusations of TDS. The truth is that <em><strong>anti-Trumpism is in large part defined only in opposition to Trump</strong></em> (see the campaigns ran by the DNC in 2020 and 2024). This means that just as Maggats make themselves a Christ figure in the form of Big D, so called TDS-Havers cast him as The Antichrist in response. To them, Trump sits at the other end of moral axes, the pure and perfect expression of evil on the level of the individual AND the political. Completely incapable of doing right.</p>
<p>The only truth Maggats can’t accept, and the truth that rational minds <em><strong>must</strong></em> accept if Trumpism is to be defeated, is that Trump has only ever represented two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the level of the individual: a pathetic, narcissistic, and senile old man, similarly unfit for office as another recent target of Trump’s tendency to make confessions in the form of accusations.</li>
<li>On the level of the nation: a monster of our making, the result of failed collective shadow work the country over. A simple expression of our own worst tendencies and a reflection of the ever present dark side of American Identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth that, as much as we love to root for a hero and need to rally against a villain, there is no Messiah, no one to save us except ourselves by the sweat of our own brow and the strength our own hands, and no Antichrist, no monsters besides the ones inside our own souls in need of saving.</p>
