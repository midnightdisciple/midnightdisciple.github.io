<p>The monsters are inside you.</p>
<p>It’s a line I come back to a lot, I don’t really know why but there’s something so fundamentally moving about it. It’s true as well of course, though it may be more accurate to say “you are the monster”. There is no ontologically defensible boundary between your worst traits and some other separate you. For all intents and purposes, ‘you’ are everything that is wrong with you.</p>
<p>If it’s any consolation, you’re also everything that is right with you. Every perspective on and facet of your nature exist in their totality. There are no contradictions. All is one and all is well.</p>
<p>A human soul is like a tree, growing always in response to the conditions of it’s environment. We can and should not judge a tree for it’s inability to grow as we see fit. A tree grows only in accordance to it’s given nature and it’s level of fitness to where it found it’s original seed planted. In the same way, we cannot judge ourselves (or others for that matter) for growing how we have, in the only way that we can. All we can do is grow on.</p>
<p>I think maybe my greatest fear, what scares me the most is that I’m the monster. In the truest sense, not just that my greatest fear is myself (that’s actually true for everyone whether or not they know it), but that something about my true self is so abhorrent to others that if it were revealed that no one would ever be able to look at me the same way again.</p>
<p>Okay fuck that.</p>
<p>I’m so fucking pissed man. Like, fuck me. Life is such a bitch and for what? I’m mad because I can’t help but be mad too, there’s no real substance behind the emotion. I even hate writing this because all I want to do is write something nice, write something hopeful or with a more uplifting sort of voice, but all I can manage is to moan on about souls and monsters. Go fuck yourself, me.</p>
<p>This is a journal entry now, fuck you it’s my website I’ll write what I want.</p>
<p>I’m one week sober today which is cool (not that I’m staying sober by any means, just laying off stuff for now while I focus up for finals and whatnot) but everything in my life feels so totally not cohesive right now. I’m up at 4 am writing this because I went to sleep at like 7 pm. My sleep and wakefulness are all over the damn place. I also pretty consistently feel physically weird in short bursts throughout the day. I don’t really know why any of this is happening.</p>
<p>I’m moving out of my current apartment in like a week and my schedule and sense of routine are dissolving as I move through these final days. Maybe I just haven’t been hitting the gym enough. I guess that for me, the stability of my life and mind has almost everything to do with what I anchor them around. As the number of anchor points decreases, it seems I become increasingly untethered from any sense of anything. That makes sense though, life is just what you make it, so the less I anchor it around specific deliverables, the less it’s made of anything in particular.</p>
<p>Getting high did a lot of me in terms of anchoring, as I reevaluate my relationship with substance use I see that, even apart from any physical dependance (which was minimal overall, I prefer stuff that’s not to physically addicting anyway) the drugs kept me in a clean psychological and behavioral loop.</p>
<ul>
<li>get high</li>
<li>over the next few days recover and get back to work on the basics</li>
<li>fall into a routine, get excited for next time</li>
<li>finish up for the week/whatever time increment, prepare for the next high</li>
<li>go again<br>
It’s simple but this loop basically got me through the semester, as stupid as it is. I think I heard once that in order to understand addiction, you don’t look at what’s wrong with it, you actually have to figure out what’s RIGHT with it. What is the addictive behavior doing FOR the addict.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, addiction was a shortcut to routine, stability, structure. Doing drugs comes with a built in reward structure for everything that you do. Why should I clean my apartment? Why should I hit the gym or the books extra hard this week? Why should I show up to work and try my best? All the answers are the same, so at the end of the week when I finally use, it’ll be that much more rewarding, feel that much more substantial and meaningful for all the work I did to get there.</p>
<p>For now, I’m floating. In the absence of defining my life’s meaning and structure around drugs, it’s not really defined around anything. I know that the potential for that meaning still exists within me. I just have to find a new way of bringing it out. Something that feels real, something that feels tangible, and something I can do with some degree of regularity should do the trick.</p>
<p>We’ll see what I can wrangle up.</p>
