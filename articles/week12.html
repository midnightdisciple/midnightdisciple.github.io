<p>When you align with something, you align against something else. This is inevitable. The dark follows from and is entailed by the light. This is easily grasped when framed through the lens of psychology. When you express yourself, you are aligning yourself with some aspect of your experience, some feeling, but almost always, you are leaving something else out. This unspoken aspect of yourself, equally real as what you choose to express, is your shadow.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the hero’s journey, the hero must face The Abyss, where they undergo a symbolic (as well as sometimes literal) death, rebirth, and transformation. After this, they return home, to where the journey began and find it different. In truth, it is unaltered, and it is the changes they have undergone in the course of their journey that changes the perceived character of their old home.</p>
<p>This process mirrors the incorporation of the shadow. The Abyss is, in fact, the inner darkness contained within us all. No one survives contact with The Abyss and lives to tail the tale, because the tale is always told by whatever being emerges from it, which is most certainly not what went in.</p>
<hr>
<p>In all my experiences in wrestling with the mundane and the existential, I have always found this question, the question of sustained identity to be one of the most challenging and most interesting. In gazing into The Abyss, having it gaze back into me, I have felt myself morph, slip away, reform, contort, balance, fall, climb, and so much more. Every facet of my identity, the rock upon which I build myself has become so fundamentally altered that at times it seems there is no possible way that that “me” is this “me”.</p>
<p>What’s quite funny though is that I struggle with the other end of this polarity simultaneously. I have often felt like no matter what I do, there’s some fundamental and fundamentally wrong part of me that I can never escape. That no matter where I go or what I do, there’s a piece of metaphysical dogshit stuck on my shoe and it always sticks to any ground I walk on and stinks up the place.</p>
<p>Obviously, these can’t both be true, either all is lost or something is always preserved. Or perhaps the answer is more paradoxical. Perhaps all of this is a simple case of mistaken identity.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am neither the me that was then, nor the me that is now.</p>
<p>The only thing I’ll never escape is the present which eternally rests underneath me.</p>
<p>I am not the baby born to my mother, nor the body that will lay in my grave.</p>
<p>I am not the naive hero who ventures beyond the threshold into the unknown, nor the changed and seasoned one who returns from The Abyss.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am the process by which then becomes now,<br>
all that changes and all that remains,<br>
the path through life and beyond,<br>
the medium through which the dark and the light are made one.</p>
