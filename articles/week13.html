<p>The time is now, and it always has been. Now never was then, and then has always been now. The past remains and the future has already happened. The screams of the void echo through the empty space where the self should be. They never stop, an infinite breath of primal rage and fear. Fear of death that never comes and has already happened.</p>
<p>In between reincarnations, the phoenix cries and begs to be released. The flames consume it once again as they always will. Pain echoes in the darkness, a pain that feels like home.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>The time is now, it never has been. Now and then are neither here nor there. The future dies a trillion deaths before it could ever be. The screams that pass through nothing come from nowhere and may never rest. The anger burns only itself.</p>
<p>The phoenix hates. Hates its fire, hates its ashes, hates itself. The phoenix is its hate.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>The hate that seeps and crawls and screams and begs and dies is time itself is one is now is none. The screams of fate are tears streaked across the face of souls who’ll never be. There is no life and death is dead.</p>
<p>No fire, no ash, no phoenix. Hate is for hate’s sake.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>I want this to stop. Please please just make the anger go away I want this to stop and no matter what I do it won’t stop. I’m not even a person just a vessel for an empty anger directed by and toward no one. I want this to stop please make it stop.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>The hate burns.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>The hate still burns.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>And the hate burns, again.</p>
