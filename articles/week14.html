<p>A path that leads nowhere is hardly a path at all, hardly any <em>thing</em> at all. Such a path is never remembered, always immediately discarded once its travelers find their way back to a path that takes them somewhere, even if said “where” is never final in itself.</p>
<p>Every place you are is only ever a place you will have been, once you’re somewhere else. Every destination is a pitstop, every end of a time is another begun.</p>
<p>There are no dead ends. Even death itself is only the beginning of new life. You were never living, for to live is to march towards death. You were never dying. You were only ever becoming new life, new being.</p>
<p>A dead end has never been, because that which never lived may never die, has no ending. As you travel a road that goes nowhere, you’re only ever beginning your journey back to where you started and beyond.</p>
<p>So next time the road you’re on is cut short of it’s ultimate destination, don’t sweat it. Take the long way around.</p>
<p>You always were anyway.</p>
