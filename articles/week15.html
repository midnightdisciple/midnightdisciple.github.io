  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="on-enlightenment">On Enlightenment</h1>
<p>Enlightenment is considered the be-all and end-all of the spiritual path. I’m not so sure. Here’s my take on the matter.</p>
<h1 id="part-1---inner-peace-is-hard-fought">Part 1 - Inner Peace is Hard Fought</h1>
<p>The irony of inner peace is that it has to be fought for, viciously. Peaceful people know this, but they also know that the true and only battle for peace is the battle against oneself, fought within.</p>
<p>Master Oogway says, “The past is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called ‘the present’.” Any attempt to write such a sentiment off as corny, cliche, or otherwise unworthy of consideration is ultimately self-defeating. For any critique levied fails to consider that it must be delivered presently.</p>
<h1 id="part-2---time-is-super-not-real">Part 2 - Time is Super Not Real</h1>
<p>In some versions of Christian theology, God, and therefore heaven, are said to exist outside of time, making God omnitemporal, and making life after death with him not an infinite existence&nbsp;<em>in</em> time. Rather, heaven is just existence inside God’s eternal now.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Buddhism or Hinduism, Nirvana, liberation from reincarnation and desire, is achieved alongside complete and total awareness of the present moment.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific traditions or theologies involved, it seems there’s a concordance on something like the transcendence of time. This is because, “time” the thing, is trivially not real. Time as we know it is an conceptual framework we use to organize experience. It’s just a model, not a part what it is we’re trying to model.</p>
<p>Without a time concept that defines them as such, the past is not distinct from the future, meaning that events don’t have definitive starting or stopping points. Without a model that holds separation in this way, reality is one big flow. What we see now is a part of the same structure, same construct that we saw yesterday, saw the day before, that people a thousand years ago saw then.</p>
<h1 id="part-3---conclusion">Part 3 - Conclusion</h1>
<p>The name of the game is transfiguration, as one thing ebbs, another flows, as one passes on, another comes to be. Neither part is the whole, the whole is both parts.</p>
<p>All is one and one is now.</p>
<p>If enlightenment is real, which it isn’t.<br>
I’d tell anyone looking for it to remember that there is no enlightenment, only existence.</p>
