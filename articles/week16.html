<p>Anything.</p>
<p>That’s what I’m supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>“Anything”, in this case, meaning anything except what I’d actually like to do.</p>
<p>“What I’d like to do”, in this case, meaning anything except what I know I should do.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we want the wrong things.</p>
<p>“Wanting the wrong things”, in this case, meaning either wanting something that’s bad for you, or wanting something you don’t want.</p>
<p>“Wanting something you don’t want”, in this case, meaning the desire for something that is, by it’s nature, unfulfillable.</p>
<p>“Unfulfillable Desires”, in this case, meaning…</p>
<p>The search for a summer that’s always a little less fun, a little shorter, and a little more normal than you thought it would be, than you remember it being last time.</p>
<p>The craving for a cookie that always leaves your mouth a little dryer, your stomach a little sicker, and the craving a little stronger than you thought they would be, than you remember them being last time.</p>
<p>The itch for a high that always leaves you questioning when the last time you managed to scratch it was, or why scratching it always makes the itch come back stronger.</p>
<p>Satisfaction is a myth created by corporations as a marketing gimmick to sell you on the concept of your own incompleteness, and thereby your own completion.</p>
<p>Have a good night.</p>
