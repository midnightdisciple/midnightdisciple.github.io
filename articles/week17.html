<pre><code>A loving heart and an open mind create the necessary space for evil to flourish.
Just as the road to Hell is paved with good intentions,
the seeds of destruction are sewn in the soil of tolerance.

<p>The morning air was calm, only slightly colder than the weeks prior. A wind whistled through the valley, carving along the cobblestone streets as the morning son shone over the hillside. This wind, coming from nowhere and headed no particular direction, carried a clinging kind of emptiness, the kind of emptiness that aches even when one wishes it wouldn’t. The wind caught on the only cottage for miles in either direction. As it did so, the man inside was disturbed by a sudden knocking at the door.</p>
<p>The man took a few moments to contemplate what he had just heard, to contemplate whether he had heard it. As he did so, the knocking came again. Now sufficiently unsettled, the man stood and strode for the door.</p>
<p>The door came open, the man looked out, stared a moment, looked down, and took a step back. On the man’s stone doorstep was a letter in a plain and yellowish envelope. Quickly, before picking it up, the man considered the possible origins of the unmarked postage; curiously, he considered this far more than the letter’s apparently apparitional deliveryman.</p>
<p>In the man’s mind, no reasonable guess as to the sender of this envelope could be asserted. No living relatives, no acquaintances or friends for many years. His residence was unknown to the few that knew him. This troubled the man.</p>
<p>After closing the door, the man sat down at the square wooden dining table in the house. He pondered the envelope. He considered a great many things that might be in it, and great many more things that might not be. He considered for so long he eventually forgot the envelope and its true content, simply carried on, caught up in all sorts of ideas and fantasies about what such a thing could contain, and where its contents might take him. These considerations made the man in turn very happy, very fearful, and very weary.</p>
<p>In the end though. The man thought the envelope more trouble that it was worth. He pushed its possibilities across the table, stood up, and simply left it to go about his life unimpeded by such considerations.</p>
<p>And there it remains.</p>
