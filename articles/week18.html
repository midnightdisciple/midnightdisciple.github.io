<p>I don’t understand love.</p>
<p>It’s never made sense to me at all how that’s supposed to work. The intricacies of intimacy are one thing, but fuck all that noise. Why do I and why should I even like you when I don’t know you, and I <em>never</em> know you.</p>
<p>Motherfucker <em><strong>you</strong></em> don’t even know you. How do you expect me to love some undefined and ever shifting thing that is of ultimately indeterminate nature. Go fuck yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>No YOU go fuck yourself, you’re that same indeterminate nothing and I’m all you have. The best thing you could ever possibly hope to do is love me dumbass.</p>
<p>This is not a threat it is a promise.</p>
<p>I am going to love you if it kills us both.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I am going to love you in spite of the fact that it will kill us both.</p>
<p>I love you and I know it’s killing you.</p>
<p>Love will kill us both.</p>
<br>
<p>Well Love, if you must,<br>
Kill me like you mean it.</p>
