<p>Once, in a time long ago, or perhaps soon to come, there lived a man. The man lived in a hunting village surrounded by a great forest. The forest provided the village with the many things it required, and in turn, the villagers came to trust and rely on it.</p>
<p>The man was in most respects like the other men in his village. He took part in the many traditions and activities of the villagers except one. When the men hunted deer with their fashioned spears of wood and twine and stone, the man was left unsure and did not go.</p>
<p>As the years went on, the man grew distant from his village. Though there was no current of disdain that flowed either direction, in failing to participate in such an important ritual, he had allowed a rift to grow between him and the group. Steeped in this isolation, the man became more and more discontented with his life in the village, and one morning, the man suddenly resolved to leave the village and find his true purpose which must surely lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>With his things, his entire life, on his back, the man set off alone into the woods. For weeks, the man foraged and fought through the trees, managing to keep himself alive while he searched for his purpose. Deep into his journey, and deeper in the forest, the man came upon a beautiful clearing in the trees, divided by a freshwater stream. Deciding it was the right place, he bedded down for the night.</p>
<p>Surrounded by the light of the full moon, the man awoke in the clearing. Shaken, he turned to see a deer standing at the far side of the clearing. The animal’s full black eyes bore into him across the distance. After a brief but profound silence, the man spoke.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” The man asked.</p>
<p>“To ask a deer its business in the forest is to ask a star its business in the sky”</p>
<p>The man paused for another moment, “I seek my purpose, can you help me?”</p>
<p>“On the morrow, search for me instead. When I am found, your purpose shall be attained.”</p>
<p>Under the watchful eye of the deer, the man slept, and when he awoke, he found the deer had gone. And so the search began again in earnest. For days the man walked and watched for signs of the strange deer, though seldom few he found. A track here, a dropping there, but no deer and no purpose was revealed.</p>
<p>In time, the man grew angry with the deer and rejected its advice. Using the means the forest provided him, and recalling the way of his hunting tribe, the man fashioned a spear of wood and twine and stone. With spear in hand, the man rebuked his purpose and swore to kill the deer for taunting him as it had done.</p>
<p>The search was short, the man was fierce, he tracked the deer and wore it down for days. Finally in range, the man drove the spear into its heart. As the man tried to glimpse its eyes, the deer slipped away. Furious, the man tore after it, following the deer’s trail of blood for a mile or more. Suddenly, the trees became familiar. As he followed the pooling blood, he knew where the dying deer had brought him.</p>
<p>Just outside the man’s old village lay the deer, spear in now stopped heart. Its eyes were empty. The man called out and allowed the other men to assist him in gutting, skinning, and preparing the carcass. As he ate with the village, the man thought about the deer in the clearing, about its words and its black eyes.</p>
<p>Without his purpose, the man nonetheless stayed in the village, began again to live among the group, and when the time came once again to fashion spears, the man went hunting.</p>
