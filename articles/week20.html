<hr>
<p>When I dated Jocelyn, I knew something was wrong. I didn’t want to know this, I wanted to avoid and suppress any knowledge of this reality, but to avoid knowing something, to keep it hidden from even yourself, you have to know exactly where you’re sure it isn’t. Repressing memories is similar in a certain respect. In order to make sure something stays forgotten, you have to deliberately put it somewhere you’ll know not to look for it.</p>
<p>My suppression weapon of choice is to overwhelm my body’s memory with more and more unbelievably intense experiences, forcing the memories so deep that they have no chance to resurface. Of course, I always remember anyway.</p>
<p>A memory is usually comprised of a few key sense impressions, bound by emotion. In recall, sometimes an emotion brings back the sensations, and sometimes a sensation brings back emotions.</p>
<p>Just when I think I have managed to bury the truth somewhere I’ll never have to find it. A singer’s voice glides with effortless perfection through the melody, it becomes my hands that ran along the curves of your body. The perfection there I couldn’t bring myself to see, the music I couldn’t listen to.</p>
<p>I hear the music, you’re beautiful.<br>
I feel your body, I love you.</p>
<p>I forgot, but the music remembers, it holds you like I couldn’t bear to.</p>
<p>I miss you, I’m sorry.</p>
