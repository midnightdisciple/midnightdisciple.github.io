<p>The man thought back to his time in the infirmary. How clouded things had been then, how clear they were now. He wasn’t even sure that what he remembered was real, how could it be? The nights of endless confusion, of waking from dreams into yet more dreams and from those into nightmares that couldn’t be real and yet were. It was too much to accept.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall screamed in pain. The man knew at once that he was still in the infirmary, that this was yet another dream. The scene looped again, just as it had before. Muzzle flash. Searing pain. Total darkness. Again.</p>
<p>Muzzle Flash.<br>
Searing Pain.<br>
Total Darkness. Again.</p>
<p>The muzzle blinked white, but the light froze, just hung there. The pain came still, crept slowly across the man’s face. The man stood up and walked towards the light. The light consumed him totally, and was suddenly gone.</p>
<p>Now in the dark, the man waited to loop again.</p>
<p>The loop didn’t come again.</p>
<p>Relief, though the pain persisted. The man was grateful to be free, free to remain trapped in the darkness. The man considered the possibility, the high likelihood, of his own death.</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling quite alone, the man’s thoughts turned to God. Probing the depths of his consciousness for what he hoped might be there after all these years, after all these loops.</p>
<p>Eventually, the man found the place where he knew God should be.<br>
The darkness there stared back at the man and said nothing.</p>
<p>And the man woke up, face in the dirt.<br>
And there was no infirmary, there never had been.<br>
And there were no dreams and no loop.<br>
And there was no light and no darkness.<br>
And there was no God, nor any place he should be.</p>
<p>The man got up and went on.</p>
