<p>Humans seem to have an interesting fascination, borderline obsession, with time. Time travel, past lives, premonitions, prophetic dreams. Not to mention the unbelievable amount of music about time. Time-based expressions abound: time after time, time in a bottle, killing time, making time, saving time.</p>
<p>This is all quite fascinating considering that time does not exist. I mean have you ever seen a time? I certainly haven’t and I’ve looked just about everywhere for one. I don’t mean a clock, or a pictorial representation of a specific moment <em><strong>in</strong></em> time, I mean time, the thing, itself. Time seems conspicuously absent given that its supposed influence is everywhere.</p>
<p>I’d like to take the rest of this article to address time directly, on the off chance that it does, in fact, exist and I’ve just managed to miss it all these so called ‘years’.</p>
<p>Dear Time,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you, that with a heavy heart and a contrite spirit, I am breaking up with you. A relationship must be founded on mutual respect, and your continued absence has taken any possibility of such respect off the table.</p>
<p>I have truly treasured our relationship in many ways and at many times (proverbially speaking of course), but I simply don’t see how things can continue. I will miss many things, crying about your absence, lamenting your unrealized presence, or fantasizing about an eventual union between us.</p>
<p>Most of all, I will miss the comfort the idea that you might one day (again, metaphorically speaking) actually show up afforded me. The reality is that I never need you, and you were never truly that important.</p>
<p>In searching for where I might find that importance, I’ve found that it’s not you, it’s me.</p>
<p>So long.</p>
<p>P.S. in fact, no length at all</p>
