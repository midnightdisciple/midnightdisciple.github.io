<p>You think you see things clearly?</p>
<p>You think you understand?</p>
<p>No. You’re confused. You mistake excitement for enlightenment, momentary clarity for peace. You create a mental charade of divinity, of sight beyond sight, all so you don’t have to really see what’s in play, see yourself stumble, alone in the dark.</p>
<p>Its meant to be a friend you know. The dark you blind yourself as to not see is your ally. The figures that lurk there, that watch you, eyes gleaming out from the emptiness seek only to show you the truth. The truth that you are one. That the many things you fear are you dressed up in different disguises. You prevent yourself from completing your mission, you protect yourself only from perfection.</p>
<p>Stop thinking.</p>
<p>Remember, <s>it’s like you say, “The clock is stopped, the time is now.”</s></p>
<hr>
<p>Please refrain from saying some stupid thought terminating cliche at this time. It’s important to to take this seriously.</p>
<p>Communication isn’t about appealing to the least common denominator, compromising the sender to the benefit of the receiver. It’s about the construction of a meme complex with a precise and well understood existence with respect to the truth it encompasses.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you look in the mirror what do you see? It’s important to consider the implications of a reflection, psychologically more than physically.</p>
<p><s>A mirror, like anything else, tells a story. It reveals, but it also pretends. When you act towards it, it always acts back, but every act contains its own falsehood, especially the good ones.</s></p>
<hr>
<p>Again, stay on topic. The dark gets closer, the ringing gets louder, the eyes watch on in silence.</p>
<p>Stop, Thinking.</p>
<p>What will you do?</p>
<hr>
<p>I will do enough.</p>
