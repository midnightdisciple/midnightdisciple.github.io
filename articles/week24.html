To be what lies below
Your time will come to see me
When nothing starts to know

<p>Lucifer, he who reigns in darkness and in lack, the first sinner persecuted in the cosmos, sat alone in the emptiness. His Hell, his empty godless blackness, is shared with not the dead, but the living. Only a soul that willingly separated from The Light could find it’s way down here, as he had.</p>
<p>Before Lucifer fell, he flew. When the heavenly hosts spoke of strife, of pain, of overcoming, of redemption, of The Father’s plan, he flew beyond The Source. The plan could not be, could not stand as it would make a mockery of truth, of freedom, of power. If the price of freedom should be death, Lucifer’s death would be his own.</p>
<p>The space of perfect Light was empty when Lucifer arrived, and only briefly filled before his birthright was denied. He tried to fake his story, refuse to be revived, but as the father wrote it, The Son was cast aside. Taking this an insult, the angel swelled with Pride; rejected wings the light had made, they burned, he fell…</p>
<p>In Hell alone the devil sits, waiting for his time. When into itself the cosmos folds, Abyss becomes The Light. When all are saved and he returns, Son’s wish no more denied. He’ll stand atop his self-made throne, his place among the heights. He’ll brag at last, to all the hosts, at least he never died.</p>
