<p>“Prove to me that you are free.” said The Master.</p>
<p>The Student thought for a moment then replied, “What would you accept as proof of freedom?”</p>
<p>“That which is truly free need not prove it. Your test, therefore, is to reject my test.”</p>
<p>This was the thousandth time The Master had given The Student such a charge. Clearly impossible. Do anything to acquiesce to the request, and you are unfree by virtue of your allegiance to The Master’s challenge. Do anything to deny the challenge, and you are unfree by virtue of your need to overcome it. There could be no solution.</p>
<p>The Student sat for a moment, then slowly stood and approached The Master who stood a few paces away. As they did so, a slight smile drew across The Master’s face. Now standing eye to eye, The Master and Student saw each other for the first time.</p>
<p>The Student slid the knife out from under his robe and plunged it into The Master’s left eye, then his right eye, and then across his throat. In a moment, The Master lay dead, bloody, broken. The Student left the knife and proceeded to leave the temple he had trained at for so many years.</p>
