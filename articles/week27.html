<p>Wreathes of fire breathe around my hands, there is a garrote around my neck. The figures to each of my sides hold the ends of the wire, keeping me bound, in pain, helpless. I try and fail to scream. I outstretch my arms, wrapping my hands around the wire on either side, and burn it away. The chord snaps.</p>
<p>Immediately, my power surges, I blast to the right, then the left. What once bound me is rubble. My throat aches but I feel energy begin to creep back in around the edges, healing my astral body once more. I return to form.</p>
<p>The download completes.</p>
<p>I view life through the lens of problem solving. Every situation is wrong somehow and so must be altered in some way. When you search for problems and their solutions, what should be, instead of what is, you avoid a confrontation with the truth. Avoidance becomes dissociation becomes psychosis.</p>
<p>That’s the loop.</p>
<p>It’s repeatedly walking the isles of a store in search of an item you know you won’t find.<br>
It’s a circle missing it’s middle like a delicious donut.<br>
It’s running lap after lap expecting to get somewhere new.</p>
<p>All that circles round is never centered.</p>
<p>Seeker no more.</p>
