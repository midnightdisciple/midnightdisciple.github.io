<h3 id="i---the-king-and-the-prince">I - The King and The Prince</h3>
<hr>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a King, the master of himself and of his world. The existence of such a king necessitates another time, upon which there was a Prince. The Prince, not yet complete in himself, was to become The King, just as The King was once the Prince. Now however ordinary this all might seem, what complicates the situation somewhat is The King and Prince’s uncanny ability to speak to each other across time.</p>
<p>When The King speaks to The Prince, it is always in moments and regarding matters of the utmost importance. When The Prince speaks to The King, it is usually to complain about whatever inane nonsense he’s decided to be bothered by this week. As you can understand this creates a rather frustrating dynamic for <em><strong>both</strong></em> parties.</p>
<p>The Prince doesn’t necessarily appreciate The King’s messages, and The King doesn’t appreciate The Prince’s lack of appreciation. When the two occasionally manage to agree on something, things tend to work in their favor for the next while, until, inevitably, The Prince slips back into his usual ways.</p>
<p>Recently, the two seem to be getting along. The Prince sometimes can’t understand The King, but has come to appreciate that maybe he doesn’t always have to.</p>
<h3 id="ii---the-jester">II - The Jester</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Jester is the vessel, the stage upon which The King and Prince perform for each other. To the Jester, neither Prince nor King is the truth, both are masks, merely actors in their grand performance. The Jester revels in this performance and seeks only its endless dance of drama, its twisting turning frights as well as delights. It takes no side besides their own.</p>
<p>In this way, The Jester stands in for The Court itself, never condoning or condemning, merely facilitating each role and its unique contribution to the story.</p>
<h3 id="iii---the-princess">III - The Princess</h3>
<hr>
<p>The princess lies atop the mount, inside a chamber in a faraway tower, and in a forbidden dungeon so dark and so deep as to never be found. All three at once and also none are true. The Jester hides The Princess from The Prince; her true location always uncertain and yet always somehow out of reach.</p>
<p>The Prince knows she must be perfect, he hopes to one day slay The Jester and relieve The Princess of her captivity. He suspects it is this act alone that shall mark his ascension to The Throne and allow him to cross over, becoming who he was always meant to become.</p>
<p>However perfect, however important The Princess may or may not be, The King never speaks of her, nor any Queen she may become. The Prince, for his part, doesn’t seem to mind this omission on the part of The King. For even if he doesn’t know how the story ends, the play must go on.</p>
<h3 id="iv---the-question">IV - The Question</h3>
<hr>
<p>To you who have stumbled onto this quaint and simple fable, a question falls upon you. As the story unfolds, The Prince seeking The Princess and his coinciding Kinghood, The King guiding and presiding, The Princess awaiting rescue, and The Jester between them all.</p>
<p>To whom does the court, the play, belong?</p>
