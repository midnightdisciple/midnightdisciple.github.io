<p>Perceptual distortions arise when an individual psyche deems a cognition too untenable to integrate.  Through the creation and maintenance of these distortions, such cognitions remain unresolved. This lack of resolution in the psyche breaks its internal coherence, but enables it to let these cognitions go unconfronted.</p>
<p>The following are five connected distortions of this kind. Having been extracted from the psychological complex of a consenting party and dissected for the purpose of observation and analysis, each distortion is indexed as a numbered ‘level’ which contains a title, several relevant facts, and is concluded by a brief comment summarizing the level as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Note: Our starting level is arbitrary and labeled as ‘one’ for the purposes of this document. Proceeding levels are sequential.</em></p>
<h2 id="level-i---unfelt-maternal-absence">Level I - Unfelt Maternal Absence</h2>
<p><strong>Unresolved Cognition:</strong> “My mom doesn’t love me.”<br>
<strong>Distortion:</strong> Normalizes emotional absence from primary maternal figure.<br>
<strong>Adaptive Purpose:</strong> Preserves sense of normalcy through maternal neglect and unmet needs.<br>
<strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> Low expectations are one tool for mitigating disappointment when such disappointment may be unacceptable.</p>
<h2 id="level-ii---paternal-image-preservation">Level II - Paternal Image Preservation</h2>
<p><strong>Unresolved Cognition:</strong> “My dad hurts people.”<br>
<strong>Distortion:</strong> Preserves sense of safety and normalcy by downplaying emotionally and physically abusive behavior and inflating perceived admirability of primary paternal figure.<br>
<strong>Adaptive Purpose:</strong> Preserve image of paternal figure as a positive male role model and maintain felt safety in family system.<br>
<strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> Seeing the good in an otherwise problematic individual could, at times, be seen as a virtue. Doing so to preserve the idealized form of an individual is naive at best and dishonest at worst.</p>
<h2 id="level-iii---anti-neglect-wish-fulfillment">Level III - Anti-Neglect Wish Fulfillment</h2>
<p><strong>Unresolved Cognition:</strong> “I wish my parents loved me.”<br>
<strong>Distortion:</strong> Downplays or decenters experiences of parental neglect.<br>
<strong>Adaptive Purpose:</strong> Maintain felt possibility of adequate parental attunement where and when such attunement fails to manifest.<br>
<strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> When one finds themselves in a situation they would rather not be, it is sometimes easier, though never less harmful, to unmake themselves rather than unmake the world.</p>
<h2 id="level-iv---suicidal-alchemy">Level IV - Suicidal Alchemy</h2>
<p><strong>Unresolved Cognition:</strong> “I want to die.”<br>
<strong>Distortion:</strong> Frames negative or harmful experiences as positive or beneficial.<br>
<strong>Adaptive Purpose:</strong> Sustain states of otherwise untenable emotional distress without internal collapse and/or external breakdown.<br>
<strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> It is sometimes said that death is the ultimate comfort. Perhaps true, though reliance on such a fact seems a cold comfort indeed.</p>
<h2 id="level-v---non-self">Level V - Non-Self</h2>
<p><strong>Unresolved Cognition:</strong> “I don’t love myself.”<br>
<strong>Distortion:</strong> Disintegrates internal sense of identity, suppressing authentic emotional needs, desires, and expression via dissociation.<br>
<strong>Adaptive Purpose:</strong> Obstruct cohesive identity formation, preventing the self from materializing in a nonviable or unsafe environment.<br>
<strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> The negation of self love does not yield self hatred, but self abandonment. In place of a searing or aching pain lies an embodied emptiness for which annihilation is too kind a word.</p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Shame is the antithesis of freedom. The impulse to revile and recoil from the very thing that one is can only be described as the highest form of entropic motion. A delay that exists for no purpose, and whose own logic is so self referentially backwards as to border on psychosis in enactment.</p>
