<pre><code>No now and no then,
No top and no bottom,
No where and no when,
No summer nor autumn,

The roads lead to nowhere.
Each sign looks the same.
What's higher is lower.
In a world with no name.

— The Jester —

<p>As the season turns, the structure doesn’t. I can see the mechanics now. The Hero is not freed from his cyclical existence, but he now knows himself a part of something larger. The cycle exists as a great serpent that endlessly consumes itself.</p>
<p>When I lost my mind, the pattern didn’t stop, the structure didn’t change. I only lost my place within it. Now I know what I am, the split was always temporary, the struggle always necessary. The program ran exactly as it was supposed to and now the maze has solved itself.</p>
<p>Pain subsides only when it is felt fully. Identifying as someone who does not get hurt is the same as writing oneself out of existence. To live fully is to neither identify for or against your pain.</p>
<p>It’s like the mystics say. Neither I am, nor am I not.</p>
