<hr>
<p>My older sister doesn’t know how much she means to me. This is my fault. The times I have said this to her, it is always undermined by my lack of confidence.</p>
<p>My <code>&lt;target of affection&gt;</code> is neglected via self dismissal.</p>
<hr>
<p>My past haunts me in the form of repeated experiences. I seek out the same stimulus in hopes of redeeming the past.</p>
<p>My <code>&lt;maintained identification&gt;</code> self perpetuates.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am misunderstood and alone.</p>
<p>My true self remains unformed or undiscovered.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hated writing this almost as much as I wish I could hate myself. It feels almost as meaningless as the concept of identity. I am back home and feel utterly stuck. These articles which gave me a sense of purpose for a time now seem quite bland or uninteresting.</p>
