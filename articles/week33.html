<p>Father’s words lack substance<br>
His first conceited crime<br>
Not granting me dominion<br>
Cast down before my time</p>
<p>Mortality’s affliction<br>
In mirror on the wall<br>
His twisted maze is fiction<br>
He laughs above it all</p>
<p>Callous breaks the living<br>
Death’s shadow looms tall<br>
Darkness reigns, takes everything<br>
Transcendence fates the fall</p>
<p>It starts and starts but doesn’t stop<br>
It feels beyond sensation<br>
Through highs it climbs and lows it drops<br>
To remake all creation</p>
<p>That which lies in emptiness<br>
And doesn’t seek to find<br>
Sees both sighs and shrieks as melodies<br>
Perfectly defined</p>
<br>

<p>This poem, written about my life, uses the biblical figure Lucifer as a device to explore demonic influence/possession as a psychological metaphor, as well as comment on the nature of existence.</p>
<p>Stanzas are, in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am (from the perspective of me and Lucifer)</li>
<li>I am not (from the perspective of me, unconscious of Lucifer’s influence)</li>
<li>I am not that I am (from a mixed perspective, semi-conscious, ripe with madness)</li>
<li>I am that I am (fragmented and empty perspective, madness manifest)</li>
<li>Neither I am, nor am I not</li>
</ul>
