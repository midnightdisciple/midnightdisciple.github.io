<p>The king is dead. The kingdom declines in his absence. The prince, having been raised to marry and follow in his father’s path, now lacks his only source of guidance and yearns to fulfill his purpose. When this noble prince came of age, he decided to venture forth beyond his kingdom and seek to find a princess whom he could marry, or any way of restoring the kingdom to glory</p>
<p>The prince departed to journey alone for many years and through many lands, yet failed to find any means of accomplishing his task. As his journey grew long he began to worry for the fate of his kingdom. He knew that he must secure his future shortly, or let his kingdom become lost to time.</p>
<p>When still the prince found no success, he sought help from beyond. The scrolls of sages and mystics he had been made to study in boyhood told of an ancient being that would aid those with sufficient need. From beyond the realm of man, this being had no name, had never been seen directly, and never stayed anywhere long.</p>
<p>When the prince used the old ways to open a portal to her, he found himself in an empty witch’s hut. In the crooked wooden shack where nothing was, no witch emerged, no offer was made, no words of warning were uttered.</p>
<p>“My kingdom is dying.” The prince stated hesitantly.<br>
“You’ll have to ask nicely.” The reply didn’t come, “State your request, then eat.”<br>
Before the prince could respond, he felt the room, the air itself, shake with a manic energy between laughter and rage. Instantly he was outside, the hut gone like it had never been.</p>
<p>In the prince’s pack was an apple, bright red and perfectly round.</p>
<p>He made his request, “Make my kingdom great again.”</p>
<p>The prince bit the apple, and as he did so his vision spun. Time unwound around him. He saw the past as if it were the future, and his awareness fell into an inky blackness at the bottom of his mind.</p>
<p>The king awoke. He ruled the restored kingdom just as his father before him. He taught his son of the nothing in the hut and of the aid it provided their family. The son idolized his father and, as he grew up, sought to follow his same path.</p>
