I find it's better not to be

<p>The doctor had gone weeks without sleeping. This was normal for the doctor and within seemingly acceptable parameters according to all previous measurements. The doctor cataloged these measurements every four hours before and after defecating. Vitals, brain scans, weight, and tissue density all gathered to continuously evolve the doctor’s understanding of itself. It had been taking these self-measurements for 18 months. It hadn’t made any progress.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that every once in a while, the doctor’s memory would seemingly self-wipe days or weeks of experience clean, leaving massive stretches of time unaccounted for. The measurements for these times always <em>appeared</em> correct, with minor deviations within statistically acceptable levels, but could not be verified.</p>
<p>Cyclically, every 24 hours, the doctor would write down its thoughts, building toward a conclusion on the exact nature of its existence based on its observations. Each day’s thoughts concluded, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>The doctor’s mind was exceptional. It always considered every possible connection, extrapolation, abstraction, or approach with regards to the data, but, as of yet, has been unable to make any definitive statements about itself.</p>
