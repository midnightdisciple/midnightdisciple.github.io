<p>I put off writing this article over the weekend, kind of. It’s more accurate to say that I got way too high after initially <em>planning</em> to write this article and was consequentially completely unable to.</p>
<p>That’s too bad.</p>
<p>I feel like I have missed a lot of opportunities in my life because of similarly backwards priorities. I’ve been <em><strong>too high</strong></em> probably far too often.</p>
<p>Too high up in my head, to high and mighty to come down and deal with reality on reality’s terms.</p>
<p>That’s too bad.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to be afraid of the truth.” is a saying I repeat often, but it seems like the truth may be the only think I’ve ever <em>truly</em> been afraid of. The truth that I’m just like everyone else, the truth that I’m not owed anything by this experience, the truth that my success, by whatever standard I wish to measure it, as well as my happiness, are ultimately up to me.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved conceptual frameworks, models, maps of meanings and ideas. The purity of discrete logical nodes in the graph of reality. There’s something so powerful about them, even outside of the truths they attempt to express. More fundamentally, a chart, a list, a graph, a series of interconnected nodes, a well thought out diagram, all attempt to assert the same thing. They say, “This is <em>true</em>, this <em>makes sense</em>, this <em>fits together</em>.”</p>
<p>I’m a person in a social environment with rules and expectations, I’m an evolved animal built to survive and reproduce, I’m an awareness wrapped in a body and a mind, what difference does it make? These labels and rationalizations sit on top of what’s real, they attempt to encapsulate the infinite, a symbolic substitute for experience.</p>
<p>None of that matters, I just want to be free. <em><strong>THAT’S</strong></em> the truth, that’s what I’m afraid of. That deep down I’m trapped, stuck, unfree in a profound way. Models, abstractions frameworks, to me, are a tool to attempt to free myself from the shackles of reality, but any framework constructed on the premise that you are unfree, can never grant freedom, only ultimately reinforce itself while you remain trapped.</p>
<p>The question is not, “Why can’t I x?” but instead, “What <em><strong>can</strong></em> I do.” You must do what you can with what you have, nothing is required, and there are no excuses. As I learn to embrace it, I learn that life is made free, for everyone. The Prison is made in the mind, The Maze exists only in the eye of it’s occupant. My belief in The Trap is what kept me stuck in it’s grip.</p>
<p>That’s a bit better.</p>
