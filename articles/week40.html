<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong><br>
Why don’t you just talk to them?<br>
Like, don’t you want to know?<br>
The truth of what the truth is<br>
Is told and then will show</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong><br>
To bravely show just what I know<br>
May seem at first the key<br>
Not so<br>
Suggesting showing of that me<br>
To free my growing knowing’s plea<br>
Shows knowing not the truth I seem<br>
To know</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong><br>
With all untold at time of telling<br>
And interest swelling<br>
Truth be told<br>
I’d not idly sit beside thee<br>
And let what’s known<br>
Remain unshown<br>
So given that I’ve given time<br>
A helping of your mind in mine<br>
Is owed<br>
Your truth is what I’d like to see<br>
The part thee deems I ought or need<br>
To know</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 2</strong><br>
What seems to be<br>
And bothers me<br>
The thing I think I know<br>
The truth that lies inside what’s shown<br>
A knowing I can’t know<br>
Nor own<br>
The unknown known holds knowings<br>
From it these knowings grow<br>
They grow just as the first did<br>
To grow and see and know<br>
Yet more below<br>
It’s such a deeply backwards knowing<br>
To invoke<br>
That perhaps you’ll think me broke<br>
For merely saying reeks of playing<br>
Though I spoke the way I know<br>
Not play nor show<br>
Its pains me dearly<br>
To name clearly<br>
Or in any way evoke<br>
This knowing that I know<br>
And somehow don’t<br>
In the knowing’s game<br>
From empty known to known<br>
The same<br>
A trick is played<br>
Just unknown knowing blowing smoke<br>
Perhaps its empty nothingness<br>
Is only a sick joke</p>
<p><strong>Speaker 1</strong><br>
I see your plea and answer thee<br>
Alone<br>
Atop your fear a knowing lies<br>
Unknown<br>
This knowing just might be<br>
That what you think you know is true<br>
Your greatest fear of all<br>
Of course<br>
Is that the joke’s on you</p>
