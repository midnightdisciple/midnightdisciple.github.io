<p>I love the sound that chalk makes on a whiteboard.<br>
Or the little white flecks it throws around.</p>
<p>I also love the sounds a woman makes when she’s aroused.<br>
Or the little trembles in her body that reward my efforts.</p>
<p>I love the smell of gasoline, and many other things others find grotesque or strange.<br>
Or maybe I just love the fact I have certain things to myself.</p>
<p>I love that when I see the truth for what it is, it always upsets me.<br>
Or the fact that my broken heart mends only to break more fully.</p>
<p>I love that this poem doesn’t exist, is merely a collection of letters on a page.<br>
Or the self-realization that there isn’t one.</p>
