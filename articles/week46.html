<p>Writing about how life contains contradiction is fucking retarded. A preschooler learns that sometimes they get sad and sometimes they get happy.</p>
<p>Playfulness is the spirit that one must be enraptured by to truly appreciate these contradictions. Childishness is the only salvation in a world that offers no inherent purpose or meaning.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to be happy even thought that’s the only thing I’d like to do. At the same time, it seems like I would be naturally quite happy if I hadn’t learned to be otherwise.</p>
<hr>
<p>I absolutely despise this paradigm of writing like I understand some important fact about life. I’m genuinely below even the lowest form of intelligence or wisdom. Even a flower knows not to doubt it’s place in the world, it simply follows it’s directive to absorb water, light, and grow.</p>
<p>I think I’d rather kill myself than face the emptiness that comes with certainty. If I know who I am, what is there left to do.</p>
<p>Make happy, make fun, be free.</p>
<hr>
<p>For a while I was delusional. I thought this artist was talking to me or about me through their music. If you’ve been paying attention maybe you know which one.</p>
<p>I have to say that I maybe prefer delusion as a mode of being. It’s absolutely better than reality except for the very crucial fact that it isn’t real.</p>
<hr>
<p>Please, please, please let me out. I don’t want to do this anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m like if a bad person was good, or like a good person was bad. I’ll never be what I could be or what I want to be because I’ll always be what I am.</p>
<p>I’ve accepted my own death. It seems like that might be the only way that something like me finds any form of relief. Knowing that it will happen even gives me a taste of that peace now.</p>
<p>Cold comfort, I think I’ve said that before.</p>
<hr>
<p>A part of my hopes my death won’t be as meaningless as my life.</p>
<p>I know that’s not true. Obviously it’s delusional to believe that I could overcome my own fundamental nature.</p>
<hr>
<p>I do like delusions though. It’s like a one sided paradox.</p>
<p>A delusion allows you to experience something as true even though it isn’t. So rather than having to hold space for two emotional truths, you get to have it one way that is both ways.</p>
<p>Something about cakes and eating them too.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe one day you’ll let me go.</p>
