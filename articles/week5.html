<p>Hello—The journey starts with a word. That word being ‘hello’ in this case. Now hello is as fine a word as any other, but I’m sure you were expecting something much more exciting. Now from my perspective that hardly seems fair but I’ll allow it in this case. How can I blame you for not knowing the significance of a story before it’s begun, but I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s begin again.</p>
<p>“Hello there dear Reader.” said The Narrator to the Reader.</p>
<p>The Reader continued reading. As readers tend to do. For the Reader is free only to read, and not to respond to that which they read.</p>
<p>“Well that’s awfully rude.” snipped The Narrator, “Here I am, trying to engage with you, as any good narrator should, and you reject my attempt at it.”</p>
<p>The Reader, still <em>somehow</em> unable to respond, simply read on, just as they had before. With perhaps a bit less determination than before.</p>
<p>Sensing this hesitation, The Narrator quickly piped up again, “Hold on now, I see I may have upset you, but you see that’s only because you don’t yet understand. I’m the best there is, graduated top of my class at Narrative University. I know all the best storytelling tricks from setup and payoff, twists, satisfying character arcs, narrative cohesion, thematic resonance. You name it, I know it.”</p>
<p>The Reader, largely unimpressed with The Narrator’s slew of buzzwords, continued on in search of something with more substance.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait. I got it, I know what readers like, they like epic tales with knights and kings and dragons and kingdoms. You want that? I can do that.” The Narrator offered.</p>
<p>The Reader continued on, apparently unaffected by The Narrator’s emotional appeals, though their pace across the page may have sped up slightly.</p>
<hr>
<p>The forest is cold, the air still. A few powdery snowflakes hang in the air. The Knight glances around at the outstretched limbs of the nearby pines and notices their subtle shifting through the tension in his body from lack of sleep. He presses forward. Again and again his footfalls deform the soft snow beneath his feet, making crunching sounds so soft as to be almost indiscernible.</p>
<p>The barrier materialized out of the air in front of him as he walks. Shimmering with a translucent white sheen, it gives off a subtle ringing sound. Recognizing the barrier as the mountain’s warding enchantment, The Knight approaches. As he does so he unsheathes his sword, a silver blade with bright orange and blue gemstones on either side of the hilt.</p>
<p>The barrier reacts to the sword’s presence almost immediately. It’s sound warbles and distorts and the surface of the solidified mist hisses and warps. The Knight holds the sword in front of him and watches as the barrier, unable to withstand the heat emanated by the blades enchantments, melts and pulls back from the sword in the shape of an ellipse. He steps through.</p>
<p>Just as he does, before he can even appreciate his recently acquired blade’s handiwork, a roar echoing from the mountain above sets The Knight into action. Widening his stance, and moving his sword to a defensive position, he looks up and sees the source of the noise.</p>
<p>The white dragon leaps from its perch and begins to descend on The Knight, coming towards him in a wide arc at first, then turning it’s massive wingspan to the side and banking into a dive. In some horrible mimicry of a bird of prey, the dragon tucks it’s wings to maximize the speed of it’s attack. Though on second thought, The Knight realizes, the dragon’s form may be the object of the bird’s mimicry.</p>
<p>White dragons aren’t the smartest, but with the lack of nutrition in their arctic environments, they tend to be hungry. Usually, this is more than enough to make them formidable. The Knight had known he would face obstacles on his quest for the sacred tree held in the ruins atop the mountain, but now looking up at the sixteen-ton behemoth with pearly scales and spiky barbs coating it’s sleek and muscular body hurling towards him at terminal velocity, he wondered if had made the right choice in coming here.</p>
<p>Almost upon him now, the dragon snarled and began to extend its front claws, twitching with eager excitement.</p>
<p>The Knight raised his sword…</p>
<hr>
<p>“See? I told you I could entice you. I’m sure you have lots of questions.” The Narrator interrupted, “Where did the knight get his sword? What else can it do? What’s this sacred tree all about and why does The Knight seek it? But most importantly, how will our brave hero slay the dragon.”</p>
<p>The Reader considered these question and their possible answers.</p>
<p>“Well for that, dear Reader, you’ll just have to tune in next time!” exclaimed The Narrator, “Oh I do hope you come back, it was great fun. Next time I’ll have even more story for you I promise. I might even tell you the significance of the word ‘hello’.”</p>
