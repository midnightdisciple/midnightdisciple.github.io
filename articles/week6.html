<p>The demarcation of any boundary is always arbitrary. This is not to say that boundaries do not exist, just that the exact point of distinction between the two things either side the boundary has no definitive or absolutely correct position.</p>
<p>Take age as an example. ‘Adult’ and ‘Child’ are distinct categories, the instantiations of which (that is, individual adults and children) are typically easy to distinguish. But the question of what constitutes an adult, precisely, is unanswerable. Any possible system that sought to classify them exactly would introduce countless vectors of subjectivity and be almost endlessly subject to critique and debate.</p>
<p>Further, this applies to less abstract concepts like the ordinary objects that exist in our world. There is no set-in-the-metaphysics-of-reality basketball, car, or camera, there is only undifferentiated quantum phenomena. These objects are constructed mentally and socially as much as they are physically. How it then that humans writ large can communicate with a shocking level of clarity about many of these things and seemingly hallucinate others into being on a whim? We can because when we describe and thereby invent these abstractions, what we are truly doing is <em><strong>reifying phenomena</strong></em>.</p>
<h3 id="nature-of-consciousness-and-reifying-phenomena">Nature of Consciousness and Reifying Phenomena</h3>
<p>Consciousness, that is, our metaphysical window into reality and source of qualia or subjective feelings (call it ‘experience’ or ‘awareness’ if you’d like), is a special kind of ‘thing’. It is metaphysical or phenomenological in nature. This means that we don’t experience objects directly, meeting them on the level of physical reality. The physical world is rendered into a collection of subjective impressions or qualia in consciousness.</p>
<p>From our perspective, the perspective of consciousness, objects are phenomena with distinct sets of relational properties. What I mean is, every experience that we define is always <em><strong>in relation</strong></em> to us, the conscious observers experiencing and defining it. Objects and their properties are therefore not objective <em>or</em> subjective in nature. They instead exist at the intersection of object and subject, pertaining to the objective physical world and the subjective phenomenological world at once. You can call this type of relational truth “transjective”.</p>
<p>A classic example of a transjective truth is the thirst quenching property of water. In an ‘objective’ sense there is only the quantum phenomena arranged in a patterns we call water molecules, as well as a human body. In a subjective sense there is a sort of craving, physical discomfort, and a sort of motivating ‘pull’ towards water and a cessation of these phenomena when it is consumed. No property like thirst quenching can arise from the water alone, it is only in relation to a drinker who <em><strong>experiences</strong></em> thirst as well its relief that the property can be meaningfully spoken of or engaged with. This example is illustrative but more importantly generalizable. Replace thirst quenching for blueness or bigness or quietness or roughness and the same truth holds.</p>
<p>The human brain, likely trained via evolutionary fitness, filters a raw undifferentiated conscious experience into individual discrete ‘things’. Physical events are rendered into sensation and represented pictorially in the form of vision. It is the job of the ego to interpret and filter this raw sense data into logically isolated pieces, that is, to reify phenomena.</p>
<p>In a very hippie and simultaneously very basic sense, our beliefs create our reality, on the level of the immediate and the abstract. We make useful assumptions about our environment that determine how we interact with it, and we implicitly assume that any goal we take up is possible to achieve. <em><strong>That very assumption</strong></em> creates the necessary conditions for its possibility.</p>
<p>Our internal subjective worlds carry massive amounts of baggage that simply do not exist in the external objective world. The most negative as well as the most positive aspects of our experience are simply ideas in our head. Things are never <em><strong>as bad</strong></em> or <em><strong>as good</strong></em> as they seem, they just are. Our capacity to imagine the world as far better or far worse is a dreadful curse and a glorious blessing; by doing so, we can see the world remade in our image, for good and for evil.</p>
<pre><code>In the same way that your heart feels and your mind thinks,
you, mortal beings, are the instrument by which the universe cares.
If you choose to care, then the universe cares.
If you don't, it doesn't.

<p>We are realities true creators, in an ever evolving dance with the world around us to shape and be shaped by it. We are the waking universe, glimpsing itself, and as we do so we mold it in our image through our beliefs and perceptions, like two mirrors pointed towards each other.</p>
<p>This is our responsibility. We are presented with reality as we see it, and are tasked with shaping it in turn. We cannot reject this task, as even the rejection reshapes our world. It is said that one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. I would go one step further, it is only after reconvening with our destiny can we realize that our avoidance was always part of it. Stories always write themselves, and furthermore, are always about their authors.</p>

<pre><code>There is always some madness in love.
But there is also always some reason in madness.

<p>A common form of psychotic delusion involves feeling like the radio, movies, music, etc contain secret messages that some unseen force is attempting to communicate to you. More broadly, this can be characterized as ‘belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning’ (taken from googles information on psychosis symptoms).</p>
<p>This type of experience is shared with other people whom we might not ordinarily consider psychotic. Religious people often speak of having innocuous experiences and concluding that they are some form of divine prompting or message, and users of psychedelic drugs often report similar profound feelings happening as a result of otherwise ordinary experiences while under the influence. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>It is my view that this happens for a very simple reason, <em><strong>all meaning is made</strong></em>. If we understand that outside of a very narrow band of what is objectively happening, human beings move in the chaotic and subjective world of what we might take from and make of that, then it is obviously true that <em><strong>any event</strong></em>, no matter how mundane it “objectively” is, should it resonate deeply enough with an individual, may go on to change them internally, and those internal changes, if sufficiently big, will inevitably manifest in their actions and back into the external world.</p>
<p>Meaning is not extracted from but rather projected onto our experience. In the act of ‘reading into’ an event, we instead reveal our internal feelings and ideas that may have been hiding under the surface. The act of interpretation is as much an exploration of ourselves as it is what we are attempting to interpret.</p>
<p>Everything that happened in the entirety of some faraway musicians life led them to the creation of a song, and you happened upon it in just the right context to bring forth a series of profound feelings, ideas, or realizations followed by a personal transformation. The acoustic vibrations may be simple physical phenomena, but your experience of and your change in response to that song is <em><strong>undeniably</strong></em> about you. How could your story be about anyone else?</p>
