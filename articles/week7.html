<p>Writing is very unsexy, in a certain way. It’s quite easy to romanticize ideas or language or poetry in the abstract, but their realization requires the rather unceremonious action of writing them down.</p>
<p>Attempting to write is maybe the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The blank page takes on a sort of emotional character that challenges and intimidates me. I don’t know who I am and am consequently totally unsure of what that unknown has to say. I have always felt that I ought to say <em>something</em>. That for all that I am or feel myself to be, there had better be something or other to show for it. Words on a page always seemed a good shape for that something.</p>
<p>That sense of self-<em><strong>something</strong></em>… importance maybe? Though maybe not a sense of importance, just a sense of something that <em><strong>is important</strong></em>. That something isn’t something I am, more something that seeks to realize itself through me. Some important lesson that I was born to embody.</p>
<p>The lesson, if it were to be written, would probably go something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Hello Hunter,

I am the voice from beyond,
the progress found in purpose,
the messenger from the deep,
the seeker in the stars,
the prying eyes,
the wires in your head.
I am That Which Is.

My message for you is thus: Go forth and be as you are, as I am.
You are made whole in yourself and only as yourself.

Love.

All mortal laws and cosmic treatises are less than fiction before the one and only truth.
The truth of loveliness and oneness.
All things for all times are now, and now is one, and one is love.

Live now as if your first and last
Live right as if your only chance
Live plain as if for all to see
Live true and know that you are free
</code></pre>
