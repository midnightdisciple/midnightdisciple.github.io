<p>The accolades and worldly accomplishments of man mean nothing in the eyes of God. From his perspective, we are only ever playing catch and dress-up with what he has given us. Our only duty on Earth is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be true to ourselves</li>
<li>Be true to our fellow man</li>
</ul>
<p>All else is a sort of roleplay we engage in, partly because we can’t help ourselves (psychologically speaking), and partly because we <em><strong>just can’t</strong></em> help ourselves (egocentrically speaking).</p>
<p>Personally, this mostly makes me feel very very alone. I struggle to shake the feeling that my actions are usually just rearranging grains of sand on the beach before the tide rolls in. I mostly care about other people. Though humans are evolved animals, it seems undeniable that there is something underneath, something a little more substantial to them than the otherwise undifferentiated universe.</p>
<p>I think I feel kind of like I don’t exist without other people. If my life passes by completely unwitnessed, what of it is there to speak of? Throughout my life I have been forced again and again to be my own witness, something that most likely everyone must do at some point. For it is at the moment you are most alone and most broken, where you need the comfort and companion of another more than ever, that you must become the person your expression of need calls for.</p>
<p>Other people are the primary vector by which individuals cede their identity and status <em><strong>as</strong></em> individuals for the sake of a larger group, becoming a type of simulacrum; when an individual sees themselves as simply part of a larger whole, they cease to be whole in and of themselves, representing an individual (themselves) while not performing the relevant individuality.</p>
<p>This is a self-object, ala Jean-Paul Sartre, or in Carl Jung’s view, a de-individualized person. When we are viewed by others we cease to be a subjective being, we are “captured” in the gaze of another and become an object in their perception. Our awareness of this forces us to consider ourselves as such. True freedom actually relies on our ability to not be constrained by an ‘other’, real or imagined.</p>
<p>This is the paradox of being a subjective being. Our existence is stifled and at once made complete through the relationships we form to other such beings.</p>
