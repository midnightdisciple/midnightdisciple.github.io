<p>I feel like I’ve forgotten something, or more specifically, like I’ve forgotten to forget something. Like I’m finally coming to at 8:30 after my dad told me to get up and get ready for school at 7, or like I was supposed to run an errand last week that I never got around to.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with forgetting, as long as you remember to do it properly. A memory that’s designed to remind you of something can leave a stub, an empty reference, if not properly removed. If you forget to forget the thing in it’s entirety, you’re left with the shape of a reminder without any substance. This manages to leave you with the impression of something unfinished, something you were supposed to get around to, but without any clue as to what it might have been.</p>
<p>Around 8:30 last night I called my mom and talked to her for the first time in a while. I almost broke down over the phone. My mother has always managed to see the best in me, it’s infuriating. It means I’m being seen for something that I am not, or that the person has access to some perception of me that I don’t.</p>
<p>I wonder if I forgot to forget something from a long time ago? Maybe I left a toy in the wrong place, or maybe I forgot to turn the chair in the corner around so it wouldn’t be facing my as I slept. I always hated that chair, felt like it was watching me. Something about that feels right, I think I forgot to do something really important, left some fundamental piece of myself in my childhood bedroom, maybe if I found it everything would make sense like it did back then.</p>
<p>I think humans are meant to be understood, if our inner world’s and live’s go unwitnessed or without any narration, there’s a sense in which we don’t exist at all. Such a shame then that we’re fated to never truly understand anything, not even ourselves, let alone anyone else. When people are alone, they talk about themselves, when they’re ono-on-one they talk past each other, and in a group, they talk into the void. No illusion of a shared space can ever close the gap between self and other.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what it is. Maybe I left my belief in connection, my belief that I could look out at the world and find something other than a reflection of myself, that I could look into another’s eyes and manage to see them for once, not trapped and objectified in their gaze</p>
<p>If I remember to forget properly, maybe one day I can stop hoping, hoping to see the impossible, hoping for someone to actually see me instead of themselves in me, hoping to be something other than what I always seem to be.</p>
<p>All alone,<br>
Lost in forever.</p>
