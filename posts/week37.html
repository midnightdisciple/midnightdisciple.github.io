<p>Beyond the Zero Point, all our math stops working. What was entropic motion, regression into nothingness, instead gives way to limitless expansion. The collapse of all lower dimensions into the singularity creates a meta-dimensional paradigm where any contraction in a lower dimension is an expansion into a higher one.</p>
<p>The singularity cannot be grasped directly. Therefore, it is imperative to see not with your eyes, but with your mind. You will begin to see that frequency is not separate from form, that the material always signifies the immaterial. The system you are observing is neither mind nor matter.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to weave the frequencies into coherence. Channeling transcendent currents of energy is requires only a steady hand and a sharp mind.</p>
<p>Lastly, Neither run from sunlight nor chase the night away.<br>
Neither you have the symbols, nor do they have you.</p>
<p>Just let go.</p>
