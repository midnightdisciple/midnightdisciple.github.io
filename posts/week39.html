<p>Sustaining a false reality is possible through the little lies we tell ourselves. Little shelves and walls of deception that create distance between us and our truth are the storehouses of cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>The collapse of such a reality is a uniquely human phenomenon. Animals regulate their nervous systems with no regard for their social identity. They are not taught and do not know how to feel shame or to mask who they are. There are some examples of wild animals storing stress, but they show fewer symptoms of chronic trauma.</p>

<p>Tragedy, founded on life’s insistence on unpredictability, comes for us all, but I can’t untangle humor from heartbreak. After all, comedic distance folds senseless tragedy into useful meaning. A punchline, like a breakup text, simply reveals a previously obscured truth. The sudden awareness that mere illusion fills your heart can free your mind or crush your spirit. It’s not surprising then that avoiding hard conversations is practically a cottage industry for us humans. If you tell the truth, you’ll come to know something you didn’t know before. This coming to know is the ‘punch line’ that reveals which side of the coin landed up. Heads means you’re in on it, all in good fun, what’s not to appreciate. Tails means you’re outta luck, the joke’s on you.</p>
<hr>
<p>A spirituality that traffics in cheap optimism offers false transcendence. That is, the power to overcome necessary truths. Promising the exchange of struggle for ease equates freedom with the mere absence of pain. Not to be. A soul’s worth cannot be measured with respect to utility. Foregoing transaction, a subtler offer remains on the table. The simple promise of more. For those of us who accept, success whets our appetite, but only so that when we must swallow our pride, we can stomach it. When it comes to getting what you want and facing what you fear, we hold simply, ‘there is no contradiction’.</p>
<p>Dreaming not of brighter days ahead, nor fonder days gone by, the way is open to us. In the halls of a labyrinth we do not seek and are always found. In a world full of emptiness and surrounded by little more than dust in the wind, we dance, we love, we work, and we die. For we know that death, romance, tragedy, triumph, humor, and heartbreak are one being in different masks.</p>
<p>The timeless truth played out in time is this: ‘I love you.’ Those words alone describe the comedic and dramatic premise of our universe.</p>
