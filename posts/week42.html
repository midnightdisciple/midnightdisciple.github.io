<p>On behalf of That Which Is, The Puppet Master, presiding now over The High Court of Mind, recognizes the following criminal complaint.</p>
<h3 id="complaint">Complaint</h3>
<p>Regarding what we see as the heinousness and severity of actions carried out by the defendant, the being referred to as Hunter Mangus, we beseech this court for remedial action. Such action is justified in light of the defendant’s alleged violation and subsequent murder of one Jane Doe (victim’s name withheld for privacy).</p>
<p>The defendant’s actions and their dark nature are known to this court via the contents of the so-called “Memory Hole” which defendant repeatedly uses for purposes of obfuscating these events as well as their true causes. The prosecution holds that this hole as well as the corresponding obfuscation’s true purpose is to avoid incrimination and therefore constitutes strong evidence of the defendant’s guilt.</p>
<p>Seeking a necessary and just resolution, we propose the court grant such relief in the form of the immediate termination of the defendant’s life.</p>

<p>While not ordinarily fitted to playing second fiddle but finding your arguments dissonant and draining. You are permitted to hear my response to the allegations and the call for defendant’s second sleep. Fortunately for the parties, dissonance is only undeveloped harmony. Seeing the prosecutions’ proposed resolution as little more than a premature conclusion to a story whose ending is worth knowing, the defense moves to hold the remainder of this trial, including its verdict and potential sentencing within the domain of performance. Performance to take the form of an interpretive dance routine which shall conclude in defendant’s tragically deserved death or glorious redemption.</p>
<p>Let’s build something for two.</p>

<p>Seeing as the defense has done little to deny wrongdoing, the court holds that any changes in venue or format are appropriate so long as the prosecution is amenable to such changes.</p>
