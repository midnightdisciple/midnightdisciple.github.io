<pre><code>It's real.

<p>I can’t seem to figure it out. The time I lost my mind and put it back together didn’t even help me learn anything new. It seemed like I only remembered what I had known all along.</p>
<p>“I’m a student of the game.” was the only identity that stuck around. So now I just learn, and learn, and learn. If you asked me what it is that I’m learning, I couldn’t give you a straight answer if I wanted to. Something along the lines of…</p>
<p>“I’m learning how to play the game.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What game?” You might respond.</p>
<p>“The game we’re all not playing.”</p>

<p>This doesn’t concern anybody? Cool beans, I guess. If the universe lacks any form of reason I suppose there’s no reason to be upset by that fact. The mind craves understanding, control, and the empty mirror demands surrender and surrender only.</p>
<p>To me, this seems like a logical contradiction. I guess you can reconcile that though if we hold that logic itself is illogical. Yeah that seems to work. I wouldn’t put any more thought into that.</p>
