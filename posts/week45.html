<p>I’m grateful for having experienced neglect. It has given me a profound appreciation for the simple, small, and slow things in life. Sometimes they’re all you can count on.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for my emotional and physical abuse because they have been powerful teachers of self love and enabled me to hold complex or contradictory truths without collapsing internally.</p>
<p>I’m grateful I lost myself, every sense and notion of what I am, so completely. Only through this loss have I found what I value most and come to accept my role in life.</p>
<p>A nightmare is a light scare in the pleasant dream of life.</p>

<p>Flowers are like if trees were really small and had cool hats.</p>
<p>Planting seeds is very romantic in a kind of way.</p>
<p>Chickens probably taste soooo good if you’re a large dog.</p>
<p>The Power Rangers could have a beautiful color-coded orgy.</p>
