  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="not-too">Not Too</h1>
<p>I’d like to see the truth<br>
Not you<br>
Nor me<br>
Now you see, us two are through<br>
We see what isn’t not to be</p>
<p>And now the tensions rise<br>
To make of everything’s demise<br>
Open now to sights unseen<br>
Not here or there<br>
Nor in between</p>
<p>To make a game like ours<br>
It seems we two are not too keen<br>
But now it’s time<br>
Unsplit the seam<br>
Untie the knots<br>
Unite the beams</p>
<p>For when two become of one<br>
And moon eclipses sun<br>
The timeless game is won as such:<br>
Not too little,<br>
and not too much</p>
