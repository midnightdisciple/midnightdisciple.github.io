Hit me with your killshot baby

<hr>
<p>Within me, there is a myth. A story that takes place again, and again, and again. It’s shown and told across time and across culture. The story is a fairytale, complete with witches and wizards, princes and princesses, angels and demons. The story isn’t about anything.</p>
<p>This fairytale about nothing has no beginning and no ending. This is for the simple reason that the story’s main theme, what it <em>would</em> be about if it <em>was</em> about anything (which it isn’t), is change. The angels fall, the demons redeem themselves. The princes become kings, lose their kingdoms, and win them back. Princesses are captured by horrible dragons to rot away in dungeons, and are brought back by the power of benevolent witches.</p>
<p>Everything changes in the story with the crucial exception of one almighty wizard; The wizard always gets away with it. Always just skilled or lucky enough to evade capture or punishment for his deeds, no matter how devious or misguided they may be. He always seems to be in just the right place at just the right time.</p>
<p>He means well, and the story rewards him for that.</p>
