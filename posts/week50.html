<p>There is a rhythm in the chaos<br>
A message in the static<br>
It tells of all the things I’ve lost<br>
Or hidden in the attic</p>
<p>I hear it when the silence speaks<br>
And echoes off the void<br>
Pointing to the pain I’ve cried<br>
And naming things I can’t avoid</p>
<p>These voices in the deep don’t speak<br>
If anything, they shout<br>
They ring and sing about the thing<br>
You never have to doubt</p>
<p>Angelic voices speak the truth<br>
The timeless game is won<br>
So every cell is empty<br>
And bells? They toll for no one</p>
