<pre><code>I can feel everything.
I can see everything.
But there's no one here.
Least of all, me.

It's all lost in the maze.

— From the diary of a mad king —

<p>Pretty silly poem right? I thought you might think so. Stings a little bit, but that’s alright. At least I don’t know that you know so. Anyway, I’m doing pretty good these days. Sorted out all my substance abuse issues and now everyday’s pretty much a nonstop-super-killer-extra-awesome-straightedge party.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, whether I’m high on drugs or life.</p>
<p>Source is source.</p>

<p>“Enlightenment,” Jesus began, “always seemed kind of like a dark joke. Everything is perfect, and you’re not even around to see it.” He slowly cracked a smile as he spoke.</p>
<p>The Buddha thought for a moment then matched The Nazarene’s expression before speaking.</p>
<p>“Maybe so.” Buddha responded, “Though darker still is the Buddhist’s charge to embrace their suffering as opposed to the Christian’s charge to merely endure it.”</p>
<p>“Enduring suffering grows one’s faith, embracing suffering increases the depths of one’s presence.” Christ synthesized, “I suppose that makes one thing we can agree on.”</p>
<p>“The trials are the blessings.”</p>
