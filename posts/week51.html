<pre><code>I can feel everything.
I can see everything.
But there's no one here.
Least of all, me.

It's all lost in the maze.

<p>Pretty silly poem right? I thought you might think so. Stings a little bit, but that’s alright. At least I don’t know that you know so. Anyway, I’m doing pretty good these days. Sorted out all my substance abuse issues and now everyday’s pretty much a nonstop-super-killer-extra-awesome-straightedge party.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, whether I’m high on drugs or life.</p>
<p>Source is source.</p>
