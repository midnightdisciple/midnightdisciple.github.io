<p>Is a blessing for anyone else.<br>
So I decided to write them both.</p>
<h2 id="the-curse">The Curse</h2>
<p>You are going to die.</p>
<p>In miniature tonight, and every night before you do the real thing.<br>
All of the things you dislike about yourself are completely uninteresting and totally fine.<br>
Your life today, and any other day for that matter, could be hellish in makeup.<br>
You don’t have to want to change it.</p>
<p>Your life is a game that a stupid person could play and still win.<br>
So if you if you ever catch yourself thinking about getting smart, remember.</p>
<p>You are going to die.</p>
<h2 id="the-blessing">The Blessing</h2>
<p>To those of you for which the earth is not enough, I leave these final words.</p>
<p>Let your resplendent wings carry you to new heights and beyond.<br>
Let the ever changing winds guide the path of your ultimate ascent.<br>
Let the sun, the source of light itself, be your target.<br>
Let your aim be singular and true.<br>
Let your eternal light so shine.</p>
<p>And when you fall,<br>
And you will fall,</p>
<p>Let the sea be there to catch you.</p>
