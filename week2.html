<p>After sitting in silence for a moment, he finally said, “So what are your plans after graduation?”</p>
<p>“I honestly have no idea, I’ll probably try to look for some internships over the next few months” I responded, with some degree of hesitation.</p>
<p>“Dude, did you see the NASA internship posted in the computing majors class?” he asked in turn. “You should have a look at that.”</p>
<p>Somewhere, the wings of a wasp twitch, the leaf it rests upon swaying in response to a passing breeze.</p>
<p>I shift in my seat before responding. “Yeah for sure, I guess I’m never sure about those, I always feel underqualified”</p>
<p>He paused and looked at me as if waiting for clarification.</p>
<p>I chuckle. “I don’t know I guess it’s just some imposter syndrome or something. I never really feel like I know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>A hand outstretched. It gestures with something approximating yearning, but with meaning ambiguously telegraphed. Perhaps attempting connection? Asserting itself? It is alone.</p>
<p>“Bro trust me, everyone here feels that way.” He assured me. “Nobody really knows what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that I agree. I feel like I’m constantly seeing people talk about or discuss or do crazy smart shit.”</p>
<p>The endless maze twists and convolutes. Recognized for what it is, the trap is sprung and the seeker, lost forever, is trapped within. The One Above laughs in knowledge of their truth and fate.</p>
<p>“Dude, what are you talking about you’re crazy smart.” He retorts. “I’ve literally learned more from our conversations than tons of other people.”</p>
<p>“Well that is a huge compliment obviously.” I admitted. “And I totally agree of course. I’ve never met anyone who thinks like you.”</p>
<p>As I say this, his girlfriend walks in, and out goes his attention.</p>
<p>She looks to him. “We have to go eat, remember?” She says.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, we can.”</p>
<p>We part ways cordially and casually.</p>
<p>The river flows unbroken. Passes over and through. Soaking and rotting a log once laid to cross it. A foolish hiker’s shoe and pant leg dampens as the river flows there too. The hiker, as the river, carries on. Passes through and over, is unbroken.</p>
